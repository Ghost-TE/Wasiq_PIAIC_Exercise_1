// Question 13
// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or 
// a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of 
// statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”


var items : String[];
items = ["I really like Audi R9","It has an absolute aerodynamic shape","It gives a good fuel milage on long drives","I would like to own it someday"];

items.forEach(element => {
    console.log(element);
});
