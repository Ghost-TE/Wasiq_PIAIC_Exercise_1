// Question 45
// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function 
// should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an 
// arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information 
// and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object 
// thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly

let car_info = make_car("Audi","R9",['Color','Red'],['Transmission','Automatic'])
console.log(car_info);
console.log(car_info.Manufacturer);
console.log(car_info.Model);

function make_car(Manufacturer,Model,...arbitrary_options){
    let car_description={
     'Manufacturer':Manufacturer,
     'Model':Model,
    }
    arbitrary_options.forEach((arbitrary_option)=>{
     let [key,value]=arbitrary_options;
     car_description[key]=value;
    });
    return car_description;

   }
